# minimal-react-typescript-scss
Minimal boilerplate to get started with your next web project in React, Typescript and SCSS.

## Purpose
This boilerplate is designed for your next React and Typescript project with a minimal yet essential setup, that is aimed to have less noise as possible and gives you the freedom to configure your own architecture on top of that.

## Approach

Webpack is used to bundle the project. `src/index.tsx` is the entry point and you can rely on your own custom styling architecture with SCSS modules.

## Setup and run

Install dependencies with `yarn install` and start coding, that's it!
To build the project, run `yarn build` and start the development environment with `yarn start`.
